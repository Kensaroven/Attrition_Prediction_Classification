# Attrition_Prediction_Classification

##### **Problem Statement**
Our client is ABC a leading firm and is doing well in the sector. It is recently facing a steep increase in its employee attrition . Employee attrition has gone up from 14% to 25% in the last 1 year . We are asked to prepare a strategy to immediately tackle this issue such that the firmâ€™s business is not hampered and also to propose an efficient employee satisfaction program for long run. Currently, no such program is in place . Further salary hikes are not an option.

##### **Data Description**
The dataset consists of 1470 observations and 8 variables. Each row in dataset represents an employee; each column contains employee attributes:

Independent Variables were:

- Age: Age of employees,
- Department: Department of work,
- Distance from home,
- Education: 1-Below College; 2-College; 3-Bachelor; 4-Master; 5-Doctor;
- Education Field
- Environment Satisfaction: 1-Low; 2-Medium; 3-High; 4-Very High;
- Job Satisfaction: 1-Low; 2-Medium; 3-High; 4-Very High;
- Marital Status,
- Monthly Income,
- Num Companies Worked: Number of companies worked prior to IBM,
- Work Life Balance: 1-Bad; 2-Good; 3-Better; 4-Best;
- Years At Company: Current years of service in IBM

Dependent Variable was:
- Attrition: Employee attrition status(0 or 1)

along with grid tuning to understand hyper parameters

##### **Techniques used in Ensemble Methodologies**
- Voting Classifier
- Averaging
- Weighted Average
- Bagging
- Boosting
